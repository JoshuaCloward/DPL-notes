Application Planning
----------------------

first give it a name

why are youu building the app


google- how can i find information on the internet
twitter - how can i let my friends know what im doing really quick

MVP - Minimal Viable Product

minimal amount that makes it what you need

when you start planning you have to plan for your mvp

try to ship enough versions as much as possible


application versioning has 3 numbers most fo the time

Major, Minor, Bug - Patch

Ruby - 2.1.2
Rails - 4.1.1

Major - Full ui or ux changes brand new functionallity more features fixed many bugs

Minor - added some new features maybe just one

bug/patch - fixed some bugs no new features same ui the features just actually work
            speed fixes, bug fixes, secruity hole fix.


list all the features you want your app to have
maybe go through and number them or mark them
out of those features which ones do you need

Feature List                MVP List          1.1.0          2.1.0
----------------           ----------        -------       ---------
HODOR- - - - - - - - - - - - HODOR!           hodor          HoDoR
hodor - 3 days - 9 days                                     HooDOR!!
HoDoR - one day - 3 days
HooDOR!! -  4 hours - 12 hours

then you can start setting up deadlines
whatever you think its gonna take you triple it



MVP List
---------
HODOR!
what are the objects that we are interacting with for this

Models
-------
 User - what all does the user have
   name - string
   email - string
   password - string
   active status - boolean default: true

Status Update - belongs to user, user can have many status updates
   blocktext - string
   posted at - datetime

Tools
--------
Relational Database
Rails - since connecting to database
Sidekick pro - $750

draw out how the site will look
what order do they go through the pages
Plan out the Flow

MVP generally isn't the prettiest

set up routes and controllers
what pages your created
what is generally on those pages
not 100% accurate just a general idea of what your actually looking for

now that you have an idea you now have a goal for you to shoot for

1. Name the App
2. Describe waht the app does in few words (i.e. what proble is it trying to solve)
3. Create your feature list
4. Sort the feature list to create the MVP
5. Sort the remaining features to create subsequent releases
6. Plan out all MVP objects (i.e. models and attributes)
7. Gather list of tools needed to build MVP
8. Discuss UI and user flow with mocks
Mockup Creators - Balsamiq, Invision App, Inkscape

By this point you should have enough information to be able to build the app
