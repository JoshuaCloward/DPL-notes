git status shows the status of adjustments meaning whats been changed and whats been commited / added
git add "" adds file to commit
git add . adds all files/everything that was adjusted and to commit
git commit -m "" adds comments for that commit and sends it up to git hub when pushed and is under the file adjustements as a comment
